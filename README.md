SUN bioscience is the world-leader in engineering industry-standard organoids. The company grows organoids using the patient's stem cells to directly test which drug works for which patient and catalyze new drug development. The goal of this research project will be two-fold.   Using the company's dataset of stem cells and organoids images, the student is expected to develop two classification algorithms: a first one to detect whether the image represents a stem cell or whether the culture is developed enough and has turned into an organoid (binary classification). The second phase focuses on the organoids as we want to build an algorithm predicting in which stage of development it is and which medication has been administered to it.   Finally, the last part focuses on unsupervised learning as we are interested in the detection of pattern changes and organoids behavior-clustering (understand why and how organoids behave the way that they do).
